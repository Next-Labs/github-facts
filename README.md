The Next Labs Public Portal--Open Letter to INTELLIGENT people

Somewhere an IT department is missing its idiot.

We have used github on and off since the begiining.  This is an offshoot account to collect data and present some other info.

One of the main purposes of the account and specifically this repo is the complete face slapping of nearly 60% of the users on here.

What the hell is wrong with you people?  Seriously...

Here's the short list of just a fgew of the things you scumbags do that pisses off the actual real coders around the site.

1. The good old readme.md

  Guess what, this page is the first thing that appears when most people click your repo.  I know that some programming is quite technical, but you can handle this file guys.  It is called a text document.  The basic code goes like this.....if you want to print the word "hello" in this file, bear with me now, it gets confusing here, you have the type "hello".  I know, deep code...  More than 70% of the repos on here have the default readme file, completely unchanged....really?  And guess what, you fork a repo and then expect to get a little traffic because you managed to hit the clone button, oh yeah, master coding there, then you should probably change the info that the origina dev put in the readme, lol.  Daily, we see this stuff and start penning the manifestos, ready to purge the world of those with disconned brains.  
  
  2. Code Language
  
     Yep, they are CODE repositories, well, most of them, and that means that it was written in some coding language, you should know, you wrote it!  When you started the repo, and there were those two shiny new buttons on the last page, one was for the readma file you will ignore and the others was there to tell the rest of us coders that you wimped out and wrote your app in Playschool Sharp or whatever drage and drop language some mid Europeans threw together because they were tired of walking you idiots through simple coding.  When you pick Python Version Dub_2, then it tells those looking of the repo list from the search which ones to ignore and which ones were written in an actuall useful code.  Over and over, the desciption says good things and there is no language chosen, click it and the code is in POS 1_0, give us a heads up and let us know that you used your Google copy and paste coding skills the put together an app or program in something like Python so we can keep driving to the next dumb_ass.
     
 We are going to stop there for the moment, or we might actuall live the dream of carbine assited brain surgery.   It is a start.
